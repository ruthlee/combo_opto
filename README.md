# Implementation of Algorithms from Combinatorial Optimization

While at the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics, one of my classes is Combinatorial Optimization, where we learn algorithms for solving optimization problems over discrete structures (i.e., graphs and digraphs). The class is mathematical in nature (meaning we focus on theoretical proofs and complexity theory for the algorithms) but I'm hoping that I can in this repository implement some of the algorithms that we learn in the class.
